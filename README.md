## Eyes Follow Mouse Cursor

In this tutorial, you'll discover how to build an engaging and interactive eye-tracking animation using HTML, CSS, and a bit of creativity. This project features two eye-like buttons with pupils that dynamically follow the movement of your cursor. Invisible sensors around the buttons detect the mouse's direction, allowing the pupils to shift in real-time. To make the experience even more captivating, the project includes hover and click animationsâ€”making the "eyes" blink and react to user interactions.
